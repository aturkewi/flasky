# Flasky

Following along with [O'Reilly Flask book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/ch01.html#idm140583871764176)

## Getting started

- Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
  - To stop using venv, use `deactivate`
- `pip install flask` (This will need to be moved to a requirements eventually?)
- `bin/run` to start the app on localhost:5000
